## Scenario:
A seasoned insight-arena user and an inveterate gambler, Batuhan logs into the system using his credentials.
1. He is interested in the upcoming Presidential Elections. In order to find the relevant polls in his extensive feed, he types relevant keywords such as **POTUS**.
2. He finds a discrete poll that might interest him. Among the choices, he finds **Biden** and **Trump**. Since the term **Biden** might be confusing for many voters, as many members of the Biden Family are prominent members of the Democratic Party, he voluntarily decides to annotate **Biden** as **Joe Biden the incumbent U.S. president**.
3. He picks Biden and bets 1000 pts in this poll.
4. By the virtue of his senior standing in the platform, he has been receiving a lot of jury invitations. He is interested in political polls, so he would be a sitting jury in a poll about the prospects of the **AfD** in the upcoming German Elections. He will vote in favour of an option and leave.
5. As a political savvy, Batuhan is interested in befriending the top-scoring users in the political polls. He checks the leaderboard, skim their names, visits their profiles, and follows the ones he is interested in.

In order to implement those features, an immense and meticulous effort has been exerted. 
1. This feature relies on semantic search. When creating polls, users assign semantic tags to each poll. Hence, when the users type in search keywords, the are semantically compared with the predefined semantic tags using wikidata API. It has been a recommended feature by the PO who believed in its viability.
2. A lot of research was rudimentary to render the annotation implementation **W3C-compliant**. In addition, faciltating the highlighting and the rendering of the annotation instances required careful study of multiple UI options offered by the **antd** library.
3. Expediting voting and making predictions is the main objectives of the API. A lot of discussions were held in order to determine the nature of the polls. It was decided that the polls will be either discrete, supporting multiple choices, or continuous, supporting either date or numerical entries.
4. In order to implement a fair system which safeguards the API's credebility, it was decided that a jury of veteran users will be convened in order to decide on the conclusion of the poll and vindicate the correctness of an outcome. Every user can apply to the jury, and his/her request shall be processed accordingly.
5. As a quasi-social-network platform, the API allows users to socialize with each other. During our discussion with the PO, it envisaged that the users should be able to seek out each other on the basis of common interests. The leaderboard serves this purpose by allowing users to fetch the most invested users per each polling genre which is determined by its ubiquitous permeance across the internet.
