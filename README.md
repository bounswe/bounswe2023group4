# About us:
Polls are of paramount importance in surveying the general population's perspective and mood, providing an immensely powerful apparatus for decision-making and strategy planning. In addition, they might be utilized for recreational purposes: many we have seen on social media platforms like twitter dredging up ancient posts to boast about their prescience and visionary perspicacity!<br>
We are group 4, tasked with building such a versatile tool. You can get a detailed illustration of the product's development process by checking our [wiki page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/wiki).
