# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Prediction Polls  
**Date:** 05.12.2023

## Progress Summary
* In the 2nd milestone we reviewed the critique we received about color layout, semantic tagging, displaying if a poll is closed or not.
* We implemented an automatic subject tagging system, added profile pictures to profile. Implemented voting page and feed page. We implemented the voting and point distribution for multiple choice polls.
* Unit testing was done mostly but needs to be improved further.
* We plan to work on semantic tagging, annotation, moderation system, and jury system until the final milestone.

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#241](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/241) is still not done because we did not decide how the flow with refresh token happens in the database. As soon as that is finished, this issue will be worked on.
* [#342](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342) is not finished because before we started working on this, we merged the email verification branch and this caused issues which prevented Şefik from working on this issue in his local database. As soon as this problem is resolved, basic comment feature will be implemented.
* [#366](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/366) [SELIN] [INCOMPLETE]
* [#344](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/344) was closed one day later it was due because of our priorities leading to the 2nd milestone.
* [#399](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/399) was mostly completed, it even has a PR merged. But this issue is not closed because the swagger documentation still does not reflect the endpoints behavior correctly.
* [#400](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/400) was closed 3 days late. The work was done mostly on time, but we didn't close the issue until we made sure that voting works in accordance with the frontend and mobile.
* [#403](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/403) was closed 1 day late. PR was linked on time but reviewing the code took less than 1 day.
* [#405](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/405) was closed 2 days late. PR was linked on time, but reviewing how point system should work for the milestone took 2 days.
* [#409](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/409) [Kutay] [INCOMPLETE]
* [#424](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/424) was completed later than expected due to a misunderstanding pertinent to the deadline of the test plan. A detailed clarification can be found in the comments.

## Risks
- We will try to implement annotations in the backend this week. We need an annotation server, getting another server might be a problem.

## Task Priority
1. Annotation Implementation. PO has repeatedly asked for our progress for annotation, therefore we definitely need to complete annotation and it should be complete.
1. Semantic Tagging. PO has asked for this feature in the 2nd milestone.
2. Moderation. In accordance with the requirements, this needs to be done so we can reliably open polls.
3. Jury. In accordance with the requirements, this needs to be done so that polls can be closed appropriately.
4. Poll UI improvement. There is some aspects of our poll ui that needs to be improved. An example would be to make closed polls appear differently.
5. Google Authentication Fix. Google authentication needs to work properly. It was mentioned briefly in the milestone.
