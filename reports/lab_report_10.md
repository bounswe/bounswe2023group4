* [#418](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/418) Yigit couldn't finish this task because he had to finish other projects. He will try to catch up this week.
* [#513](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/513) Ahmet couldn't finish this task because he needs to wait the backend to fix the end point. That's why the task is on hold.
* [#514](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/512) Ahmet couldn't find a time to finalize his work in this task. He will wrap up the task in next week.
