# Changes Since Milestone 1 and Future Plans

### Overview

We mostly focused on polls and profiles since milestone 1. Poll view, poll creation were implemented for different types of polls. Also profile view, profile updation were implemented. Some poll and profile features were added like poll tags an profile badges. We also covered some of the errors that were made in milestone 1. Thanks to these changes our application has the main functionality that our application is supposed to have. The user can customize their profile and vote and create polls according to their preferences.


For our future plans, we will improve poll UI as the data displayed by it is not obvious from the user perspective. New poll UI will make the application easier to use and more fun to explore. We want to implement poll closing for all poll types. This will complete the poll life cycle. We also want to implement moderator system since we want moderators to prevent invalid and inappropriate polls. We will also add annotations for polls which will make the polls more interactable. We also plan to add topic points and we will implement leaderboard which will compare the topic points of users and reward them with badges according to their placement in the leaderboard. This way we will have a reward system for the users that have predicted in our polls.

Below we have included our detailed additions to the project by subteams.

## Backend
### Authentication unit tests
Authentication endpoints are tested with mock data. Since the logic is in AuthenticationService class the tests are written for it. Every endpoint is tested for success and failure cases.
### Poll unit tests
### Profile unit tests
Profile endpoints are tested with mock data. Since the logic is in ProfileService class the tests are written for it. Every endpoint is tested for success and failure cases.
