### Additional information:
I have tried to resolve all misunderstandings and code problems related to backend . I have helped my teammates with their work when needed and I recieved help when I encountered problems. I tried to keep the communication alive by managing the discord channels. I wanted to make sure backend related work was always on track so I asked my teammates about their status on the work. I hope I did not cause any unnecessary stress in the team :).

## Member: Ali Alperen Sönmez
### Responsibilities: 
I've been involved in two main tasks: first, I worked on improving the UML diagrams, and second, I focused on presenting the mobile app effectively. Furthermore, I collaborated with Suzan Hoca to get feedback and guidance for enhancing the UML diagrams, which I then shared with the team. Additionally, I was tasked with implementing the sign-in page for the mobile application. However, I realized that I would not be able to complete it on time, so my teammate Yiğit Şekerci took over and implemented the mobile sign-in page instead.
### Main contributions: 
My contributions are involve revising the UML diagrams and presentation of the mobile application.
### Code-related significant issues:
I had committed to implementing the mobile sign-in page, but I couldn't.

## Member: Selin Işık
### Responsibilities: 
My primary responsibilities were divided into two categories. First part was improving our procuct design and the second one was working with the frontend team to create web aspect of our product.
 
### Main contributions: 
I have been actively involved in various aspects of the project, including the creation of the project plan for the frontend. In addition, I have played a key role in updating the project's requirements and mock-up design. I also took charge of addressing annotation requirements issues and establishing the color and theme structure for the entire project. Furthermore, I contributed to the development of several important components, such as the sign-in page, sidebar component, poll card component, and the UI for the feed page.

### Additional information:
I have actively maintained and updated the project's wiki, offering guidance and support to members who are learning frontend skills from scratch. I tried to assist these team members in their journey by providing them with valuable insights and resources. Furthermore, I have consistently provided constructive feedback on their work to enhance their skills and contribute to the overall success of our team. I am also the communicator of the group, so during lab hours I tried to improve communication between team members and product owners.

## Member: Şefik Palazoğlu
### Responsibilities: 
Setting up backend logic and database logic. Ensuring frontend structures are stored properly at the backend and are reachable.

### Main contributions: 
I have created a mySql database to store users and connected this database to our node.js application. When we started implementing JWT tokens I took part in how to store these tokens in the backend. I took part in storing username/email and password tuples and oversee the hashing protocol of passwords. I prepared and uploaded weekly reports.

## Member: Yiğit Şekerci
### Responsibilities: 
I was responsible to handle mobile app progress. I have created the project plan and assigned to the assignees but unfortunately with the one of the mobile team member's subteam change, I took his tasks. Thus, I had to do the most of the coding parts for Milestone 1 in mobile app (Which was very frustrating we will make sure that will never happen again). Also, I was responsible to check semenatic tagging requirements.

### Main contributions: 
* In management aspect:
  -  I kept mobile project plan up-to-date 
  -  I have checked the mobile team progress regularly.
* In project aspect:
  -  I have checked semantic tagging requirements.
  -  I find out what we should research in mobile.
  -  I have opened most of the mobile issues. (This should be change. This is happend because I am the one who created mobile project plan. We need to integrate others better to project plan.)
  -  I have prepared the milestone 1 release.
* In code aspect:
  -  I have initialized the mobile project.
  -  I have arranged theme for the mobile app.
  -  I have implemented token management system in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented dependency injection system in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented sign in and sign up pages in mobile app.
  -  I have implement navigation drawer in mobile app. (We didn't show this in demo but it was already implemented.)
  -  I have prepared testing enviroment for project in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented build variant system in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented base clases in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented exception handler system in mobile app.
  -  I have implemented network system (instances, interceptors) in mobile app.
