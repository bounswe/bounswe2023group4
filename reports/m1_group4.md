### Additional information:
I have tried to resolve all misunderstandings and code problems related to backend . I have helped my teammates with their work when needed and I recieved help when I encountered problems. I tried to keep the communication alive by managing the discord channels. I wanted to make sure backend related work was always on track so I asked my teammates about their status on the work. I hope I did not cause any unnecessary stress in the team :).
