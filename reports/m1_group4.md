# Milestone Review 
# Individual Contributions

## Member: Emre Batuhan Göç
### Responsibilities: 
Setting up backend endpoints and their logic. Ensuring frontend can reach backend.Preparing swagger documentation for backend.
### Main contributions: 
I have opened the routes for sign up, log in, logout, access token request endpoints. I have created service class for these endpoints and filled them with logic. I have created swagger documentation for these endpoints. I have written unit tests for these endpoints. I have created a google log in system however it currently only sends the data to backend. I have helped database configuration. I have helped frontend to create requests for backend. I took part in the issue of updating diagrams where I revised 6 of the sequence diagrams and I revised the class diagram.

### Additional information:
I have tried to resolve all misunderstandings and code problems related to backend . I have helped my teammates with their work when needed and I recieved help when I encountered problems. I tried to keep the communication alive by managing the discord channels. I wanted to make sure backend related work was always on track so I asked my teammates about their status on the work. I hope I did not cause any unnecessary stress in the team :).
