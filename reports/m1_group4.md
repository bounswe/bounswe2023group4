# Individual Contributions

## Member: Emre Batuhan Göç
### Responsibilities: 
Setting up backend endpoints and their logic. Ensuring frontend can reach backend.Preparing swagger documentation for backend.
### Main contributions: 
I have opened the routes for sign up, log in, logout, access token request endpoints. I have created service class for these endpoints and filled them with logic. I have created swagger documentation for these endpoints. I have written unit tests for these endpoints. I have created a google log in system however it currently only sends the data to backend. I have helped database configuration. I have helped frontend to create requests for backend. I took part in the issue of updating diagrams where I revised 6 of the sequence diagrams and I revised the class diagram.

### Additional information:
I have tried to resolve all misunderstandings and code problems related to backend . I have helped my teammates with their work when needed and I recieved help when I encountered problems. I tried to keep the communication alive by managing the discord channels. I wanted to make sure backend related work was always on track so I asked my teammates about their status on the work. I hope I did not cause any unnecessary stress in the team :).

## Member: Ali Alperen Sönmez
### Responsibilities: 
I've been involved in two main tasks: first, I worked on improving the UML diagrams, and second, I focused on presenting the mobile app effectively. Furthermore, I collaborated with Suzan Hoca to get feedback and guidance for enhancing the UML diagrams, which I then shared with the team. Additionally, I was tasked with implementing the sign-in page for the mobile application. However, I realized that I would not be able to complete it on time, so my teammate Yiğit Şekerci took over and implemented the mobile sign-in page instead.
### Main contributions: 
My contributions are involve revising the UML diagrams and presentation of the mobile application.
### Code-related significant issues:
I had committed to implementing the mobile sign-in page, but I couldn't.

## Member: Selin Işık
### Responsibilities: 
My primary responsibilities were divided into two categories. First part was improving our procuct design and the second one was working with the frontend team to create web aspect of our product.
 
### Main contributions: 
I have been actively involved in various aspects of the project, including the creation of the project plan for the frontend. In addition, I have played a key role in updating the project's requirements and mock-up design. I also took charge of addressing annotation requirements issues and establishing the color and theme structure for the entire project. Furthermore, I contributed to the development of several important components, such as the sign-in page, sidebar component, poll card component, and the UI for the feed page.

### Additional information:
I have actively maintained and updated the project's wiki, offering guidance and support to members who are learning frontend skills from scratch. I tried to assist these team members in their journey by providing them with valuable insights and resources. Furthermore, I have consistently provided constructive feedback on their work to enhance their skills and contribute to the overall success of our team. I am also the communicator of the group, so during lab hours I tried to improve communication between team members and product owners.

## Member: Şefik Palazoğlu
### Responsibilities: 
Setting up backend logic and database logic. Ensuring frontend structures are stored properly at the backend and are reachable.

### Main contributions: 
I have created a mySql database to store users and connected this database to our node.js application. When we started implementing JWT tokens I took part in how to store these tokens in the backend. I took part in storing username/email and password tuples and oversee the hashing protocol of passwords. I prepared and uploaded weekly reports.
