# Milestone Review 
## A summary of the project status and any changes that are planned for moving forward.
### Backend project status
<ul>
  <li>Authorization with access and refresh tokens is working.</li>
  <li>Google log in mechanism is implemented but currently collects data only on backend.</li>
  <li>Registration mechanism is working and is connected to database.</li>
</ul>

### Backend plans
<ul>
  <li>Google log in mechanism will be finalized.</li>
  <li>Poll endpoints will be working</li>

  <li>Communication with backend has implemented and it works as intended.</li>
  <li>An example feed page with navigation bar has implemented with mock data that is suitable with our mock up.</li>
</ul>

### Frontend plans
<ul>
  <li>Sign in and sign up pages will be improved and finalized.</li>
  <li>All communication setting with backend will be finalized about authentication process.</li>
  <li>Feed page implementation will be done with real data coming from backend.</li>  
</ul>

## A summary of the customer feedback and reflections.
<ul>
  <li>‘Access token’ should not be visible on UI.</li>
  <li>Poll topics should be predictable.</li>
  <li>Be more clear about the poll's status on UI.</li>
</ul>

### Backend
<ul>
  <li>Node.js has stalled the team a bit since it was kind of new among the team</li>

# Individual Contributions

## Member: Emre Batuhan Göç
### Responsibilities: 
Setting up backend endpoints and their logic. Ensuring frontend can reach backend.Preparing swagger documentation for backend.
### Main contributions: 
I have opened the routes for sign up, log in, logout, access token request endpoints. I have created service class for these endpoints and filled them with logic. I have created swagger documentation for these endpoints. I have written unit tests for these endpoints. I have created a google log in system however it currently only sends the data to backend. I have helped database configuration. I have helped frontend to create requests for backend. I took part in the issue of updating diagrams where I revised 6 of the sequence diagrams and I revised the class diagram.

### Additional information:
I have tried to resolve all misunderstandings and code problems related to backend . I have helped my teammates with their work when needed and I recieved help when I encountered problems. I tried to keep the communication alive by managing the discord channels. I wanted to make sure backend related work was always on track so I asked my teammates about their status on the work. I hope I did not cause any unnecessary stress in the team :).

## Member: Ali Alperen Sönmez
### Responsibilities: 
I've been involved in two main tasks: first, I worked on improving the UML diagrams, and second, I focused on presenting the mobile app effectively. Furthermore, I collaborated with Suzan Hoca to get feedback and guidance for enhancing the UML diagrams, which I then shared with the team. Additionally, I was tasked with implementing the sign-in page for the mobile application. However, I realized that I would not be able to complete it on time, so my teammate Yiğit Şekerci took over and implemented the mobile sign-in page instead.
### Main contributions: 
My contributions are involve revising the UML diagrams and presentation of the mobile application.
### Code-related significant issues:
I had committed to implementing the mobile sign-in page, but I couldn't.
