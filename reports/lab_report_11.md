## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#241](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/241), [#342](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342), [#399](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/399),[#539](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/539), [#540](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/540) are not finished because Şefik was focusing on annotations this week and burdened with unexpected work unrelated to the course and will make up for it in the last week.
* [#545](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/540) is an ongoing work. Şefik couldn't merge his work in time because of small mismanagement of branches. The work of annotation servers will be merged ASAP. Currently it is dockerized and deployed.
