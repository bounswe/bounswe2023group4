## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Dockerization and redeployment of our backend | [#336](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/336) | Hebun Şimşek | 14.11.2023 | [link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/336#issuecomment-1810026633) |

## Unexpected Events
- Alperen Sönmez decided to leave the course. We are trying to manage and shift his wo

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#325](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/325) was incomplete because Alperen left the course.
* [#308](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/308) was overdue due to unexpected amount of work received from other classes.

## Your plans for the next week
| Description | Issue | Assignee | Due | Estimated Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Write and Upload 7th Week Report | [#335](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/335) | Şefik Palazoğlu | 14.11.2023 | 1.5hr |

## Risks
- Backend endpoints need to be configured in accordance of front and mobile's requests. This requires constant communication which can be difficult because of workload of other classes.
