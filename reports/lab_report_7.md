## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Dockerization and redeployment of our backend | [#336](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/336) | Hebun Şimşek | 14.11.2023 | [link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/336#issuecomment-1810026633) |

## Unexpected Events
- Alperen Sönmez decided to leave the course. We are trying to manage and shift his works.

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#325](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/325) was incomplete because Alperen left the course.
* [#308](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/308) is overdue due to unexpected amount of work received from other classes.
* [#241](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/241) is still not done because we did not decide how the flow with refresh token happens in the app. As soon as that is finished, this issue will be worked on.
* Ali Nasra helped and done [#305](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/305) while he was not initially assigned.

## UI/UX Considerations
### Existing Nice Features
-  Google and normal registration are linked. Using the normal registration and google registration with the same email results in a single account.
-  In poll creation, options for creating a poll get revealed as user enters the options to not overwhelm the user.
-  Google mail selection mobile UI is intriguing.
-  We have light and dark color theme. This option considers the user's preference in their machine.
-  Mobile form validation is interactive and helps to user write their forms easily.
### Would-be Good Features if Implemented
-  We could make a landing page that introduces the site and its functionalities to the user.
-  It would be good if users could see their friends' votes in the polls they created like Instagram's likes.

## Risks
- Backend endpoints need to be configured in accordance of front and mobile's requests. This requires constant communication which can be difficult because of workload of other classes.
