# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Prediction Polls  
**Date:** 21.11.2023

## Progress Summary
* Requested changes in poll and vote endpoints are still underway, we need meetings between front and back teams to make these features work.
* Other than some needed changes in page request body format, Create Poll page is implemented.
* Email verification in signup is done but needs testing.
* Unfortunately we have some tasks that hasn't finished completely or require extra effort in backend. These are related to testing and basic poll comment implementation.
* In mobile we made significant progess however we couldn't manage to finish our tasks. Current tasks require 1-2 more days. This week we don't have that much new issue in Android but we need to review our flow to catch any possible issue for milestone.

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#343](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/343) was closed one day late because there were unexpected problems about how to restructure the database schema and deployment of the changes.
* [#344](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/344) is unfinished and deferred after the milestone. Implementing testing while also trying to change the api and database schema proved to be difficult and most of other work blocked this.
* [#359](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/359) was closed 2 days late because we needed an additional format change after the initial work is done, hence the two pull requests.
* [#241](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/241) is still not done because we did not decide how the flow with refresh token happens in the database. As soon as that is finished, this issue will be worked on.
* [#342](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342) is not finished because before we started working on this, we merged the email verification branch and this caused issues which prevented Şefik from working on this issue in his local database. As soon as this problem is resolved, basic comment feature will be implemented.
* Unfortunately mobile tasks require 1-2 days more to finish because of tight schedule.
* [Testing issue](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/317) is nearly impossible to finish as we mentioned in mobile task. We might need to merge the current one and create new one since this issue is ongoing for weeks.
* [#365](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342) , [#366](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342) are unfinished because Selin could not spare as much time as she thought due to her busy schedule. She will complete them by next week.

## Scenario Plan
Our scenario for milestone presentation includes two football enthusiast characters Ali and Bekir.
Ali is a Besiktas fan and Bekir is a Fenerbahce fan. They are good friends but they argue about who would win. Their choices should be obvious!
After their talk Ali is convinced that every rational person thinks that Besiktas will win. So, Ali goes to prediction-polls to check if there is a poll about who wins the upcoming Besiktas-Fenerbahce match at 9/12/2023.

- Ali logs in to his account and looks at the feed. 
	- 1.1.2.2.1 Users should be able to sign in with their username/email and password if they have verified their e-mail via the verification mail stated in requirement.
- Ali does not see the poll he is looking for so he wants to create a poll
	- 1.1.5.1 Poll Opening
- Ali tries creating a discrete poll Where the question is "What will be the result of the Besiktas vs. Fenerbahce football match at 9.12.2023?"
	- 1.1.5.1.2 Each poll must have a question.
	- 1.1.5.1.7 Poll opener shall choose poll type as multiple-choice or continuous.
- Ali enters the choices as "Besiktas", "Fenerbahce", "Tie"
	- 1.1.5.1.8 Poll opener shall choose the number of the options.
	- 1.1.5.1.9 Poll opener shall fill every option.
- Ali wants to set the due date of this poll, so he enters the date 9.12.2023.
- And Ali also sets the time before vote changing process to 2 hours since football matches are 90 minutes and have a break through the Create Poll UI.
	- 1.1.5.1.5 Poll opener shall choose a final voting date or vote change acceptance time-the time that system takes to accept a vote changing process-.
- Ali is redirected to the feed page, sees his recently-opened poll, and votes for it with the selection: "Besiktas".
	- 1.1.5.2.1 Members shall be able to vote on active polls.

After this, Bekir logs in to his account from the mobile app.
- Bekir logs in to his account and looks at the feed. 
	- 1.1.2.2.1 Users should be able to sign in with their username/email and password if they have verified their e-mail via the verification mail stated in requirement.
- Bekir sees Ali's poll in feed page and clicks on his username to visit his profile page.
	- 1.1.3.1 Members shall have a profile page which they can display their name, username, profile picture, bio, polls that they created, or they voted for, their domain specific badges and their domain specific ranks.
- Then, Bekir goes back to the feed page, and selects the poll and votes "Fenerbahce" in the poll.
	- 1.1.5.2.1 Members shall be able to vote on active polls.
- Since Bekir is so sure that Fenerbahce will win, he has an idea of creating a continuous poll.
	- 1.1.5.1.7 Poll opener shall choose poll type as multiple-choice or continuous.
- Bekir makes the poll's question "How many more goals will Fenerbahce score compared to Besiktas in the upcoming Besiktas vs. Fenerbahce football match at 9.12.2023?"
  	- 1.1.5.1.2 Each poll must have a question.
- Bekir answers the poll with a 2 as he believes Fenerbahce will win with a 3-1 score.
	- 1.1.5.2.1 Members shall be able to vote on active polls.
