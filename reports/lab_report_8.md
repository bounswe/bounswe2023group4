# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Prediction Polls  
**Date:** 21.11.2023

## Progress Summary
* Requested changes in poll and vote endpoints are still underway, we need meetings between front and back teams to make these features work.
* Other than some needed changes in page request body format, Create Poll page is implemented.
* Email verification in signup is done but needs testing.
* Unfortunately we have some tasks that hasn't finished completely or require extra effort in backend. These are related to testing and basic poll comment implementation.

## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Install nodemailer package | [#336](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/391) | Şefik Palazoğlu | 21.11.2023 | [#392](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/pull/392) |
| Update Schema for email verification | [#394](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/394) | Şefik Palazoğlu | 21.11.2023 | [#395](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/pull/395)

## Planned vs. Actual
* [#343](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/343) was closed one day late because there were unexpected problems about how to restructure the database schema and deployment of the changes.
* [#344](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/344) is unfinished and deferred after the milestone. Implementing testing while also trying to change the api and database schema proved to be difficult and most of other work blocked this.
* [#359](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/359) was closed 2 days late because we needed an additional format change after the initial work is done, hence the two pull requests.
* [#241](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/241) is still not done because we did not decide how the flow with refresh token happens in the database. As soon as that is finished, this issue will be worked on.
* [#342](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group4/issues/342) is not finished because before we started working on this, we merged the email verification branch and this caused issues which prevented Şefik from working on this issue in his local database. As soon as this problem is resolved, basic comment feature will be implemented.
